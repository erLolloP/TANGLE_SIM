TANGLE SIMULATION
=================
This repository contains the code with all the functions required to perform the simulation
described in the article _dRAIN: A distributed Reliable Architecture for IoT Networks_.
The code written in a python notebook is divided into two cells:
1. The first contains the functions needed to simulate the DAG structure of the Tangle.
2. The second contains the functions needed to instantiate the message generators and to set the node swarm.
---
In order to be able to use the written code functions correctly, it is necessary to:
* Start the Sympy environment. 
* Call all the actors that you want to simulate.
* And finally execute the code 
---
All simulation parameters are tunable so that you can both re-execute and extend the tests shown in the article.
